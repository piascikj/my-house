            Most people say location, location, location is the key to loving a property.  I have heard so many times over the years, "if we could just move this house to..."  This home is THE house in THE location.  The home is located just ten miles from Lands' End and Dodgeville schools, and probably even more important, the over 33 acres border Blackhawk Lake Recreation Area.  What does that mean for you?  It means 33 acres of lovely woods and pasture and a trout stream!  It means a barn for your horses and/or livestock.  It means the ability to spend actual quality time in nature.  Nature that you own.  A place for you to grow your own organic food and probably enough to share and sell at the many local farmers' markets!  It means being able to hike or run or take horseback rides on your own trails that connect to the Blackhawk Lake park trails!  It means a place for you to "get away from it all" and experience owning your own peaceful paradise, a type of serenity that many people aspire to, but few can achieve.  You know, the whole supply and demand thing.  There are not many properties like this around, much less for sale.
          %p
            The current owner has an affinity for history, and has provided a moving tribute to the property and the roles it has played over the years.  Here is what they said:
          %p
            Our farm was built in 1873 by a Norwegian immigrant named Askel Komperud.  Askel and his brother settled our land based on the Homesteaders Act.  They lived in what is now the pasture area in a small log cabin that they built.
          %p
            Askel married a Norwegian woman named Aster.  She was 12 years his senior and had 8 children of her own.  He built the house for her and her children.  His craftsmanship was well known throughout the valley as he built several other buildings, including the church on the hill in Highland on County Q.
          %p
            The farm was originally much larger and they farmed the land with cows, pigs and chickens.
          %p
            The front door and window that originally faced the pasture were discovered behind thick plaster walls and wallpaper and are now cabinets in the living room.  The trim that you see was reconstructed to mimic the footprint of Askel's original work.
          %p
            The eating area in the kitchen was originally the back porch where wood was kept and there was a wall between the living room and dining room.  The shelves in the upstairs bedrooms are where the chimneys and stove pipes would have been to keep everyone warm during cold winter nights.
          %p
            And the dark painted part of the upstairs hall is where the family hung their clothes before there were closets.
          %p
            The painting in the kitchen was done of the original farm house.  It is painted in a folk art style that was popular of the time.  However, the artisit reversed some aspects of the house and barn.
          %p
            The land is so rich in history here.  We have found numerous artifacts from ancient peoples, such as arrowheads.  Seeing as it is in what is known as the Driftless Area because it was untouched by the last glaciers,  rock outcroppings are everywhere, showing evidence of caves that would have been used as shelters by native peoples and now animals.
          %p
            The seller purchased the property a dozen years ago from an original descendent of the man who settled the property.  The seller has taken great pains to preserve the character of the home and the land while updating the home to enjoy the modern conveniences of today.
          %p
            As soon as one enters either front door, they become aware of the past and the present, and how seamlessly the two can coexist in this home that has been lovingly care for and updated over the years.  There is plenty of room for entertaining in either the family room, the living room, dining room and, of course, the country kitchen.  The warmth does not come only from the freestanding wood stove, but also in a different way, from the original hardwood floors and the comfortable and attractive color palette of the paint throughout the home.  There is a bedroom and full bathroom on the first floor for those who do not want to do stairs.
          %p
            The upstairs has a relaxing master ensuite, complete with jetted tub, and access to another room that would serve well as a nursery, walk-in closet, playroom, bedroom or office.  There is also another nice sized bedroom (remember, this home was housed a family with eight children!).
          %p
            Every room, up or down, has beautiful views of the countryside.  The family room and main floor bedroom have patio doors to let even more light into the home.
          %p
            It is hard to decide which is your favorite room and/or feature, but I think mine is kitchen area.  I say area because this is not your basic kitchen.  There is so much room for all the wonderful things that can happen in a kitchen!  For instance, the walk-in pantry has room for anything, and everything, you might need or want to stock up on (in the event you are just too happy and comfortable to leave for the weekend).  The breakfast nook is bright and sunny and is just a great overall place to gather or start the day.  I love the island.  It is one of the most unique and useful ones I have seen in a long time.  It is perfect for bonding over homework and making meals, or decorating Christmas cookies, or enjoying a glass of wine while preparing treats or entertaining.  The second front door and entry way comes into the kitchen and the laundry and back door go out the other side of the kitchen, there is an open walkway to the dining room and the stairway to the private bedrooms upstairs, and there is access to an updated half bath, so the kitchen really is at the heart of the home.
          %p
            The sellers showed me some pictures of the property through the seasons--all gorgeous!  But two really had an impact on me. They were the snowy lane and Christmas tree pictures.  The moment I saw them, I started humming Christmas carols in my mind.  I think I even said to them that the pictures would be lovely Christmas cards.  If you are looking for a place to spend the special times with those you l love, I cannot imagine a better place than this 1870's homestead just outside Highland, and only ten miles from Dodgeville.  Whether your thing is fireworks and catching fireflies on the Fourth of July or picking wildflowers or playing soccer on your own field on any spring or summer day or enjoying the long Labor Day weekend with a picnic or fishing or horseback riding to delight in the many colors of fall, you will love this place.  If your thing is hunting (deer, birds or small game), or pumpkin pie made with your own organic pumpkins for Thanksgiving or cutting down your Christmas tree and dragging it home to bring everyone together, this is your place!  If you just want to go do some great ice fishing, check out your next door neighbor, Blackhawk Lake.  You can even cross country ski over and through the park.
          %p
            So take the time to come visit us, at one of our open houses, or better yet, call Torre or Natalie at 608-574-6627 or 608-609-2027 to arrange a private showing.  If it were earlier in the year, you may have found some morel mushrooms on the property as you were walking on the trails.  Very soon, the lovely fall colors will be in full swing.  Whatever the season, this is "the home in the perfect location."
